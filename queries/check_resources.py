# A one-to-many relationship Django will automatically define a property
# named {model_name}_set as model manager .
# model manager has create (create from the main object)

# retrieve user federica93 and give one more resource her

#Forward relation: From Resources to User, you access the user of a resource via the user field. 
#child---->parent
#Bacward relation: From User to Resources, you access all the resources connected to the user using the resources_set
#parent---> child

# resource = Resources.objects.get(title = "AWS") #get a specific resource
# user = resource.user #access the user who owns this resource
# print(user.username) #print the username of the resource owner

# #forward relation: the resource model has the foreignkey(User,...) every resource belongs to the user


# user = User.objects.get(username = "federica93") #get the user
# resources = user.resources_set.all() #get all the resources linked to this user

# for resource in resources:

# #resources_set ---> backward
# #resources_set is automatically created when we use the foregnkey
# #is useful for easy getting all the resources beloging to the user without manually filtering
# #saves you from writing a filter() query every time

# #instead of writing
# resources = Resources.objects.filter(user__username ="federica93") #---> forward

# #you can simpy do:
# resources = user.resources_set.all() #--> backward

#create() 
#resource_set.add() you already have the user and it exists in the database
#and you want to just add something to it

# user = User.objects.get(username="chris")

#2 Eager loading

#If a model has multiple foreign key fields, you can select multiple relations:
